<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">Lions</a> are the only truly social cats, with related females
        living together in prides overseen by male coalitio that compete for possession in fierce and often fatal battles.
        <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/african-lion/">Lions</a> are predatory carnivores and it's the females that perform most of the hunting at night; the majority
        of the prey being antelope, zebra and wildebeest.
