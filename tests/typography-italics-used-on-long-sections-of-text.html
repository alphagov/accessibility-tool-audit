<p class="italic">Italics are sometimes used to highlight text. But you shouldn't use italicized text because they make letters hard to read. The letters have a jagged line compared to non-italic fonts. The letters also lean over making it hard for dyslexic users to make out the words. When the text size is small, the text is even more illegible.</p>
